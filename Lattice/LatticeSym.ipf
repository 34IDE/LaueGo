//
//		H = h=k
//		K = k-l
//		L = h+k+l
//
//	for Hexagonal lattice constants aH,cH (alpha=beta=90, gamma=120)
//	a(Rhom) = sqrt(3*aH^2 + cH^2)/3
//	sin(alpha(Rhom)/2) = 1.5/sqrt(3+(cH/aH)^2)
//	These equations are implented in the routines:  Hex2Rhom(aH,cH)  &  Rhom2Hex(aR,alpha)
//
//
//	Although not used here, note that the following also works:
//		NOTE Inv(A^t) = Inv(A)^t, so the order of Inv() and ^t do not matter
//		MatrixOP recipLatice   = 2*PI * (Inv(directLattice))^t
//		MatrixOP directLattice = 2*PI * Inv(recipLatice^t)
//		Vc      = MatrixDet(directLattice)		// Volume of unit cell
//		VcRecip = MatrixDet(recipLatice)		// Volume of reciprocal lattice cell
//
//		kf^ = ki^ - 2*(ki^ . q^)*q^		note: (ki^ . q^) must be NEGATIVE (both Bragg & Laue)
